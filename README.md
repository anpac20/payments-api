# Mock Payments API

This project simulates a payment processing API, replicating core functionalities. It includes endpoints for:

- Creating payments
- Checking payment status
- Requesting refunds
- Generating settlement files

The API was built using **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**, and deployed on **Render**.  
It is intended for educational purposes and as part of my portfolio.
